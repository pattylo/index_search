## My Personal Searching Engine
### Yes, I am that boring - I built a small GUI APP to automate the process of looking up some common commandlines LMAO.

If you want to give it a go, you can download this package and do:
```
cd build && ./index_search
```
Or, you can build it with cmake (you will need QT5 lib, make sure that you download that before hand):
```
cd cmake && cmake .. && make
```
